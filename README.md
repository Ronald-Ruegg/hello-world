# hello-world
starting off with Free Code Camp
I finished an intensive Boot Camp in May 2015 and have been working fulltime in a Data Steward ever since. I have had a number of different trainings including; SQL Python, R, Database Administration, Management Training and a course I am taking now from Duke University called Excel to My SQL.
